# Enhancify: AI-Powered Image Enhancement Tool

## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Image Enhancement Tool is a web-based application that allows users to upload images and apply various AI-driven enhancement techniques. This tool demonstrates the integration of advanced AI models with a responsive and intuitive React frontend, showcasing both AI capabilities and modern web development practices.

## Features

- Image upload and preview
- Multiple enhancement options:
  - Super-resolution (upscaling)
  - Noise reduction
  - Color correction
  - Sharpness enhancement
  - Contrast adjustment
- Real-time preview of enhancements
- Before/After comparison slider
- Ability to combine multiple enhancements
- Download enhanced images

## Technology Stack

- Frontend:
  - React
  - TensorFlow.js for client-side AI processing
  - React-Dropzone for image uploads
  - React-Compare-Image for before/after comparison
- Backend:
  - FastAPI (Python) for handling more complex AI models
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch for server-side AI processing
- AI Models:
  - ESRGAN for super-resolution
  - DnCNN for noise reduction
  - Pix2Pix for color correction

## How It Works

1. User uploads an image through the drag-and-drop interface
2. The image is displayed in the preview area
3. User selects desired enhancement options
4. For lightweight enhancements, TensorFlow.js processes the image client-side
5. For more complex enhancements, the image is sent to the backend API
6. The enhanced image is displayed alongside the original for comparison
7. User can adjust options and see real-time updates
8. Once satisfied, the user can download the enhanced image

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/enhance`: Accepts an image file and enhancement options, returns the enhanced image
- `GET /api/models`: Returns a list of available AI models and their capabilities

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user accounts for saving enhancement history
- Add batch processing for multiple images
- Integrate more advanced AI models for specialized enhancements
- Optimize performance for larger images
- Add mobile support for capturing and enhancing images directly from devices
